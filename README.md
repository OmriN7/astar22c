Hi! This is a group project for 22C.

Here's a brief overview of how the A Star algorithm works:

Here's what the program is missing and the distributed responsibilities of the group members:
- FAWZAN: Interface (accepting the txt file with the data)
- VAUGHN & YANG: Interpreting (converting the txt file into a 2D array and then to a graph)
- OMRI: The actual pathfinding algorithm 
- The Presentation itself
